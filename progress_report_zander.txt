Progress: Finished normal mapping. Have some effects toggling and some movement. Blending,Texturing, alpha killing are done.
Todo: Still need a shitty sorting so we can render back to front. Started on shadow mapping and environment mapping.
Game timing is still an important todo as well.
Blockers: We have been emailing Patrick with any blocks we run into. He helped us solve our normal problem on tuesday. 
We will continue to inquire about problems we have rammed our heads against for a long time.

Progress: Phong shading done, blending mostly works, alpha kill needs some work. Close to finish on texturing.
Todo: Finish alpha kill and texturing. Include toggling features on/off. Refactor code to support multiple objects.
Blockers: Our blending\alpha kill doesn't quite work right I believe because we aren't drawing from back to fron when
we move the scene around. Not quite sure how to implement that.

Todo: Continue to modularize code
Blockers: CGEL still doesn't have DIRECTX or Git. 
Need to redo structure of code to allow for individual object manipulation.
