Progress: Omni-direction shadow map mostly works. Starting physx initialization.
Todo: Initialize physx. Fix omni shadow map problem
Blockers: Can't get physx to initialize. 

//////////////////////
Date: 1/24/2013
Progress: we have a point light. Working on initializing Physx.
Todo: Point light shadow maps, create Physx scene object. Planning demo.
Blockers: Physx libraries conflicting with current libraries. Working on build and linking settings and creating Physx in its own project and recreating it in our graphics engine.

//////////////////////
Date: 1/17/2013
Progress: Multiple light source shadow mapping, shadow mapping on terrain, text on screen, particle system (Based on shader),
multiple dynamic environment maps, instanced trees
Todo: Point light with omni-direction shadow maps. Starting PhysX initialization for next milestone.
Blockers: PhysX sdk documentation is minimal. Still looking for more detailed explanations of how to use physX.

//////////////////////
Date: 1/10/2013
Progress: Used a book to rewrite code over break. Made it much much faster and smoother. Have shadow mapping and dynamic mapping.
Tons of other cool stuff like xbox controller input, terrain mapping, sky box and more.
Todo: Redo particles, multiple shadow maps, multiple dynamic cube mapping, font on screen.
Blockers: Not much. Will continue to email with specific questions.

//////////////////////
Date: 11/28/2012
Progress: Finished normal mapping. Have some effects toggling and some movement. Blending,Texturing, alpha killing are done.
Todo: Still need a shitty sorting so we can render back to front. Started on shadow mapping and environment mapping.
Game timing is still an important todo as well.
Blockers: We have been emailing Patrick with any blocks we run into. He helped us solve our normal problem on tuesday. 
We will continue to inquire about problems we have rammed our heads against for a long time.

//////////////////////
Date: 11/15/2012
Progress: Phong shading done, blending mostly works, alpha kill needs some work. Close to finish on texturing.
Todo: Finish alpha kill and texturing. Include toggling features on/off. Refactor code to support multiple objects.
Blockers: Our blending\alpha kill doesn't quite work right I believe because we aren't drawing from back to fron when
we move the scene around. Not quite sure how to implement that.

///////////////////
Date: 11/8/2012
Progress: Phong shading is close to being done
Todo: Continue to modularize code
Blockers: CGEL still doesn't have DIRECTX or Git. 
Need to redo structure of code to allow for individual object manipulation.

////////////////
Date: 11/1/2012
Progress: Created a quad, and a basic circle. Did world rotations of the scene and coloring on a per vertex basis.
Todo: Working on fixing circle normals. Draw a sphere, per object rotation and transformations over time.
Blockers: None

////////////////////
Date: 10/25/2012
Progress: Created a window, Hooked in DIrectX, cleared the back buffer and drew a triangle
Todo: Draw a quad, circle and sphere, do simple shading and perform model and camera transformations.
Blockers: None
